# Game End Scenario
Write-Host "As you confront $murderSuspect, they confess to the crime and explain their motive..."
$narrative2 = @"
Motives: 
   - The torn note found in Mr. Scott's pocket suggests that he was about to expose secrets that could ruin her 
   reputation and fortune. Mrs. Sam had the most to lose from the revelation of the family's dark history involving 
   the illegitimate child.

Connections:
   - The Library Ledger reveals that an uninvited guest had a past connection to the family; this could tie back to 
   Mrs. Sam, who may have orchestrated the invitation of this individual to create a distraction or mislead the 
   investigation.

The Poison:
   - The rare poison found in Professor Kevin's study connects to Mrs. Sam as well. As a wealthy widow with means, 
   she could have easily acquired it and used it discreetly during the dinner.

Behavior and Opportunity:
   - Throughout the investigation, Mrs. Sam's manipulative nature and charm raised suspicion. She often deflected 
   questions and was seen in close proximity to Mr. Scott just before his death.

### Final Accusation:
As you piece together the evidenceâ€”especially the hidden journal detailing the illegitimate child and the threats tied to 
the family fortuneâ€”Mrs. Sam emerges as the prime suspect. Her desperate need to protect her status and wealth makes 
her the most plausible murderer, willing to go to any lengths to keep the family's secrets buried.
